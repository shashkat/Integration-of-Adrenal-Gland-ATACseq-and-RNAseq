These are the things i need to understand to get a better idea of what is going on (probably after adding the point to resume)- 

how does identification of pseudoreplicated peaks happen in bigbed/bed files in atacseq.

what are the column headers in the bed files.

how exactly does transposase work in atacseq experiments

why pvalues greater than 1? 

why is my second scatter plot showing negative correlation?
